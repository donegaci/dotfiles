# My Dotfiles


This repo contains my configuration files (`dotfiles`) used to customise machines to my liking. They are written to work across my various devices - MacOS, Linux, and RaspberryPi devices.


I have included `dotfiles` for the following:
  - git
  - tmux
  - bash
  - zsh
  - ...

# To use
  1. Clone this repo.
  2. Run the `install.sh` script. This script creates symbolic links for the `dotfiles` in this repo to the users home directory.
